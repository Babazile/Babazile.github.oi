Before being torn apart by the apartheid regime during the sixties and seventies.District Six, was an impoverished but lively community of 55 000, predominantly coloured people.It was once known as the soul of Cape Town, this inner-city area harboured a rich cultural life in its narrow alleys and crowded tenements.</p>

          voice of the people. Parliament, therefore, is accountable to the people of South Africa.<br>
          Every five years the people of South Africa get an opportunity to cast their<br>
          votes for a new Parliament. Each new Parliament is numbered. For example, in<br>
          the elections of 1994 people voted for the First Parliament.</p>

          In its current state, the Castle is considered to be one of the best examples of preserved 17th century DEIC<br> architecture in the world.<br> The Castle is currently undergoing renovation –<br> for the first time in 20 years –<br> which will further enhance<br> its appeal and position it well to become South Africa’s next UNESCO World Heritage Site.<br>
          Today, the Castle stands not only as a reminder of Cape Town’s colonial past, but as a beacon of the city’s future.<br> Popular with locals and visitors alike, art and photography exhibitions are often hosted within its five walls,<br> as are some of the city’s premier commercial events.<br>
