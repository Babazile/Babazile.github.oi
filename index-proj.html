<h3>I would love to visit Maldives and see the beauty of an Island!<h3>
  <h4>The Maldives is a tropical nation in the Indian Ocean composed of 26
    ring-shaped atolls, which are made up of more than 1,000 coral islands. It is
     known for its beaches, blue lagoons and extensive reefs. The capital, Malé
     , has a busy fish market, restaurants and shops on the main road, Majeedhee
      Magu, and 17th-century Hukuru Miskiy (also known as Friday Mosque) made of
       carved white coral.<h4>

<h2>The District six<h2>
<h6>

District Six was a multi working-class area just off the centre of Cape Town, to the south of the Castle. Today it is an almost vacant lot, shown on maps as the suburb of Zonnebloem. Before being torn apart by the apartheid regime during the sixties and seventies, District Six, was an impoverished but lively community of 55 000, predominantly coloured people. It was once known as the soul of Cape Town, this inner-city area harboured a rich cultural life in its narrow alleys and crowded tenements. After its demise, the district became mythologised, as a rich place of the South African imagination, inspiring novels, poems, jazz and the blockbuster musical, by David Kramer and Taliep Petersen, District Six. The latter being an ex resident.

It was named the sixth district of Cape Town in 1867. Originally established as a community of freed slaves, merchants, artisans, labourers and immigrants. District Six was a centre with close links to the city and the port.</h6>
<h2>The Parliamant of RSA<h2>
<h6>In democratic countries such as South Africa, the legislature or Parliament plays a very important role. The members of Parliament are elected to represent the people of the country. They also act as the voice of the people. Parliament, therefore, is accountable to the people of South Africa.

Every five years the people of South Africa get an opportunity to cast their votes for a new Parliament. Each new Parliament is numbered. For example, in the elections of 1994 people voted for the First Parliament. The Second Parliament came into existence after the general elections in 1999 and the Third Parliament in 2004.

Parliament consists of two Houses called the National Assembly and National Council of Provinces. Each House has its own distinct role and functions, as set out in the Constitution. However, there are many instances when the two Houses act together to conduct what is called "joint business".

In the national sphere of government, the legislative power of the Republic is vested in Parliament. In other words, Parliament is responsible for making and passing laws. The National Assembly also chooses the President and is a national forum where issues are debated publicly. The Assembly also has to scrutinise and oversee the actions of the executive<h6>
<h2>The Castle of Good Hope<h2>
  <h6>

The Castle of Good Hope is the oldest surviving building in South Africa and has been the centre of civilian, political and military life in the Cape since 1666.

In its current state, the Castle is considered to be one of the best examples of preserved 17th century DEIC architecture in the world. The Castle is currently undergoing renovation – for the first time in 20 years – which will further enhance its appeal and position it well to become South Africa’s next UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Today, the Castle stands not only as a reminder of Cape Town’s colonial past, but as a beacon of the city’s future. Popular with locals and visitors alike, art and photography exhibitions are often hosted within its five walls, as are some of the city’s premier commercial events.

A great focus is also put on using the Castle as a place for community dialogue and empowerment, regularly hosting meetings and workshops. If you’re feeling peckish, there are also two spots to eat: De Goewerneur Restaurant and Waterblommetjie.

Although it has limited access for the disabled and elderly, an elevator is currently being installed to assist in this regard with an electronic tour available for guests who are unable to view all areas due to stairs.<h6>
