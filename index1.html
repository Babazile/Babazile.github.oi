          <p class="">In democratic countries such as South Africa, the legislature or Parliament plays a very important role. The members of Parliament are elected to represent the people of the country. They also act as the voice of the people. Parliament, therefore,
            is accountable to the people of South Africa. Every five years the people of South Africa get an opportunity to cast their votes for a new Parliament. Each new Parliament is numbered. For example, in the elections of 1994 people voted for the
            First Parliament.

          <img class="left img-sites" src="images/castle.jpg">
          <p class="">
            The Castle of Good Hope is the oldest surviving building in South Africa and has been the centre of civilian, political and military life in the Cape since 1666. In its current state, the Castle is considered to be one of the best examples of preserved
            17th century DEIC architecture in the world. The Castle is currently undergoing renovation – for the first time in 20 years – which will further enhance its appeal and position it well to become South Africa’s next UNESCO World Heritage Site.
            Today, the Castle stands not only as a reminder of Cape Town’s colonial past, but as a beacon of the city’s future. Popular with locals and visitors alike, art and photography exhibitions are often hosted within its five walls, as are some of
            the city’s premier commercial events.
